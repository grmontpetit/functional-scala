# About
This repository is about functional concepts with scala.

## What are functional concepts ?

Things like a Monad, Moinoid, type classes, etc...

## type-classes

This is a small example of type class usage.

I looked at https://scalac.io/typeclasses-in-scala/ to get me started.

### Why use type-classes
- Ad-hoc polymorphism: you can add functionalities to existing objects like Int, Floats and Double that you would otherwise not be able to modify.
- Extends functionalities at compile-time
- Statically type: type safe

## SemiGroup


## Monoid

A Monoid is the same a SemiGroup but with an added operation, identity.

### Why use monoids
