# type-classes

This is a small example of type class usage.

I looked at https://scalac.io/typeclasses-in-scala/ to get me started.

## Why use type-classes
- Ad-hoc polymorphism: you can add functionalities to existing objects like Int, Floats and Double that you would otherwise not be able to modify.
- Extends functionalities at compile-time
- Statically type: type safe
